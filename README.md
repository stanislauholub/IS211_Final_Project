For this project, I decided to work again with Flask, as it is ideal for creating such application as
a Book Catalog in my opinion. Initially, I made this application working in console, but it was
that interactive as wanted it to be. I could not make it multi-user that way either. I was able to
add both of these features by using Flask. I found this application easy to use and effective as it
allowed me to complete the intended task. <br />

By combining HTML pages, databases, and the main program code together, I was able to create
a mini system that works together as a single application. For example, a user can register (create
his own account), search for books of interest to him, save them in his private directory, and
delete them if necessary. The user can also see graphic presentations of book covers, in case he
wants to purchase them through, for example, an online store or find them in a library. This
feature will make the search easier and ensure that the user is able to find they book he is looking
for. In addition, by having his own account connected to the database, the user can return to all
his saved books any time. <br />
